Cerbero is an open-source multi-task learning library we've developed at <a href="https://strong.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>strong.io</Underlining></a>.
It's essentially a stripped-down, more general version of Snorkel's multi-task learning framework.
Check it out! We'd love to get some feedback.
