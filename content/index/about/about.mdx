Originally trained in Aerospace Engineering at <a href="https://aerospace.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>UIUC</Underlining>,</a> I made my way to machine learning via fluid dynamics and high-performance computing.

Currently, I'm a Senior ML Scientist @ <a href="https://strong.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>Strong</Underlining></a> ðŸ’ª where I help companies architect, develop, and deploy bespoke machine learning and computer vision products.

Aside from debugging code, you can find me training for my next triathlon or shooting and developing film.
